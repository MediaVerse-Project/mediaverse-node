This could be a contract between the different owners in case of joint copyright ownership (which could arise from co-creation), or a license that allows you to sublicense the Work.

You also declare that you are solely responsible for your use of MediaVerse and that you bear full responsibility in case of granting a license for which you do not have the legal rights to do so. This includes that you will hold harmless, indemnify and defend in law MediaVerse and the entity or entities exploiting MediaVerse in consequence of any issue with regards to the copyright of the Work you made available on MediaVerse.
